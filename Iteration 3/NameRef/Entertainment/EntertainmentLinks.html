			<h2>MJ doc never mentioned propofol</h2>
			<p><font size="3">2011-10-04 08:04</p>
			<p></p>
			
			<p><i><b>Los Angeles</b></i> - Michael Jackson was clinically dead when he arrived at a hospital and two emergency room doctors said they thought 
			it was futile to attempt to revive him. His doctor, however, insisted that they try. Both doctors, testifying at Dr Conrad Murray's 
			involuntary manslaughter trial on Monday, said Murray failed to tell them that he had been giving Jackson the anaesthetic propofol or when 
			Jackson had been medicated or stopped breathing. "He said he did not have any concept of time, that he did not have a watch," said Dr Thao 
			Nguyen, a cardiologist at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Centre, where Jackson was taken on June 25 2009. "Dr Murray asked that we not give up 
			easily and try to save Michael Jackson's life," she said. "...In Dr Murray's mind, if we called it quits, we would be giving up easily."</p>
			
			<h4>'Absolutely not'</h4>
			<p>Nguyen said Murray "sounded desperate and he looked devastated". But, she said, without knowing how much time had passed since he stopped 
			breathing, resuscitation was a remote hope. "It was not too little too late," she said. "It was a case of too late. I feared that time was not 
			on Mr Jackson's side." Murray, 58, has pleaded not guilty. Authorities say Murray administered the fatal dose and acted recklessly by providing 
			Jackson the drug as a sleep aid at his home when it is supposed to be administered in a hospital. The defence argues that Jackson gave himself 
			an additional dose of the drug when Murray was out of the room. Nguyen and Dr Richelle Cooper, who oversaw Jackson's care in the emergency room, 
			said Murray never mentioned that he had given the singer the propofol. They said he told them that he had given two doses of lorazepam, also 
			known as Ativan, trying to get him to sleep. "Did he ever mention propofol to you?" Deputy District Attorney David Walgren asked Nguyen.
			"Absolutely not," she said in a firm voice. Before leaving the stand, Nguyen said, "I've never heard of propofol being used outside of a hospital."
			She said at least three medical personnel, including an anaesthesiologist, should be present when the drug is given. Walgren asked her: "Have 
			you ever heard of propofol being used in someone's private bedroom?" Nguyen replied: "That would be a first. I've never heard of it."</p>
			
			<h4>Children</h4>
			<p>"My assessment when he arrived was he was clinically dead and given the time - it was about an hour - I thought the attempt at rescue would be
			futile," Cooper said. She has said more than an hour of resuscitation efforts at the hospital did nothing to improve Jackson's condition.
			Cooper also told jurors about trying to speak to Jackson's children after he was pronounced dead at the hospital at 14:26. "They were crying," 
			Cooper said. "They were fairly hysterical." Murray's phone records are a central part of the prosecution case. Two staffers from cell phone 
			providers identified records of his calls on the day of Jackson's death. Prosecutors intend to show records of Murray's phone calls and emails 
			from the hours before Jackson's death to show that Murray had other things on his mind - getting his $150 000 a month deal to serve as Jackson's 
			personal physician approved, running his medical practices and fielding calls from mistresses. One of Murray's former patients, Las Vegas 
			salesperson Robert Russell, detailed one of those calls for jurors last week and the phone traced a call to his number. Later in the case,
			prosecutors will further detail calls and messages Murray fielded that day, including several the physician apparently made to his girlfriend 
			as he rode in the back of the ambulance on the way to the hospital.</p>
