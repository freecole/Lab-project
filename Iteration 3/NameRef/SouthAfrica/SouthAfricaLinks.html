			<h2>Tornado: It was raining stones</h2>

			<p><font size="3"><i><b>Johannesburg</b></i> - Residents of Duduza outside Nigel on the East Rand have spoken about the devastation in their area after a tornado 
			struck on Sunday evening. "The Lord was merciful for taking only one child. You can build houses, but not lives," said Solpha Mkhtshkwa, 
			whose son Xolani, 8, died when a wall fell on top of him. "I don't know where I will sleep tonight. I don't know what to do. I don't know 
			how I'm supposed to carry on, we had just finished building the house and moved in and now my child is dead," she said as she sat on a chair 
			in front of her ruined house. Paramedics took her youngest son, Fanafuthi, 7, to be examined at a clinic on Monday afternoon after he was 
			also hit on the head by a stone or piece of wood.</font></p>
		
			<p><font size="3">Ekurhuleni executive mayor Mondli Gungubele said the tornado hit at 17:29 and by 17:32 it was all over.</font></p>

			<p><font size="3">The tornado devastated an area 
			about 200 metres wide and 2km long. Trees were stripped bare in the veld with only the trunk and a few branches remaining. "It rained stones, 
			I sat in the rain all night, too scared they would steal my stuff," said Charles Molefe, 52, on Monday. He had been in his living room watching 
			TV when the tornado hit the area at about 17:30. "The TV was blinking continuously and my wife went to look at what was happening outside. The
			next moment she was screaming and shouting about things flying through the air. It literally rained stones. Some of them fell on the roof. It 
			was terrible. "Sheets of corrugated iron flew through the air. The next moment there was the most terrible noise when the huge street light 
			from across the road fell over and hit the house. I thought it was the end. After a few minutes it was dead quiet and then you just heard how 
			everyone was screaming," said Molefe. He spent the rest of the night under the remaining corrugated iron sheets of his house, standing guard, 
			while his wife Francina slept at the neighbours.</font></p>
