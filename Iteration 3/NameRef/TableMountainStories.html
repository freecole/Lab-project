		<h2><a name="Boulders">Boulders hit Table Mountain parking area</a></h2>
		<p>2011-06-07 14:47</p>
		<p><i>Cape Town</i> - Three boulders fell on a bus parking bay at the lower cableway station at Table Mountain in Cape Town on Tuesday morning, 
		the cableway company said. The boulders fell at 08:20, before the cableway was opened for business at 08:30, Table Mountain Aerial Cableway 
		said. No one was injured in the incident.A witness at the scene who was visiting from Pretoria said she heard a rumbling sound and watched as three large rocks rolled from high 
		up on the mountain."We could see the boulders as they hit the grassed area and bounced down towards the road one at a time," Lizette Nel said.</p>

		<h4>Trees</h4>
		<p>She said trees planted near the cableway broke the path of the rocks and slowed them down before hitting the road, where tourist buses 
		usually parked. Cableway CEO Sabine Lehmann said there had not been a rockfall at the lower station since the cableway opened for business in 1929.
		"It is an act of God and not something we have had to deal with before... luckily we were closed at the time of the incident and nobody was injured,
		" she said. "Our priority is to ensure the safety of our visitors and staff... we need to review the erosion at that point on the mountain and to 
		look at ways to reduce all risk to visitors coming to the lower station." Experts would be called in to inspect the mountainside. </p>

		<h2><a name="patrols">Table Mountain patrols stepped up</a></h2>
		<p>2011-07-01 20:05</p>
		<p><i>Cape Town</i> - Extra security measures are being put in place following a spate of muggings on Table Mountain, Western Cape community safety 
		MEC Dan Plato announced on Friday."Following my meeting yesterday [Thursday] with law enforcement, SANParks and the chairperson of the Table Mountain 
		Forum [TMF], I am satisfied that all parties are committed to leaving no stone unturned to increase safety on Table Mountain," he said in a statement.
		With 25 new field rangers reporting for duty with Table Mountain National Park (TMNP) on Friday, South Africa National Parks (SANParks) had stepped 4
		up patrols in areas identified as crime hotspots on the mountain chain, he said. Four more rangers would also take up their posts shortly with more 
		expected to be employed as from August following a stringent interview process and fitness assessment.With the assistance of the SA Police Service 
		and Metro Police, the mountain chain, stretching from Signal Hill to Constantia Neck, was being patrolled 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Many 
		problems remained, not the least of which was the fact that the area referred to as "the mountain" stretched over a vast 6 500ha. All efforts should 
		therefore be focused on strategic planning and strong partnerships to boost resources, Plato said. He said that the safety partners on the forum played 
		a crucial role in being "additional eyes and ears" on the ground to assist law enforcement agencies. The safety partners were civil society 
		organisations and included Greenpoint and Oranjekloof City Improvement District, Pedal Power, Tamboerskloof Neighbourhood Watch, Table Mountain Safety 
		Action Group, Mountain Club of South Africa, and the Paragliding Association.</p>

		<h4>No guarantees</h4>
		<p>"I've also received a variety of proposals from private individuals and companies relating to concepts and the use of specialised technology to 
		make our mountain safer and will be meeting with them in due course to assess the feasibility of these proposals," said Plato. "I believe that this 
		government's 'whole of society approach' is the only way to make our mountain safer and because safety is everyone's responsibility I urge the public 
		to also do their bit to aid our efforts." Mountain users were encouraged to take heed of safety advice, not only in terms of crime, but also to avoid 
		other incidents like injuries and getting lost. Between January and now, TMNP rangers and Metro Search and Rescue had aided in 41 rescues with many 
		incidents taking place due to people underestimating the mountain and neglecting to properly plan routes and/or be properly equipped for activities.
		"Our efforts, through the TMF to increase safety on the mountain chain, are working." Altogether 30 people had been apprehended on the mountain this 
		year by TMNP rangers and were handed over to SAPS. "While there are never guarantees that crime will not happen, we will continue to increase the 
		forum's effectiveness to prevent incidents from happening and actions to address them swiftly when they do," Plato said.</p>
