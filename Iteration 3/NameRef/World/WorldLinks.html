			<h2>Amanda Knox heading home after acquittal</h2>

			<p><i><b>Perugia</b></i> - Amanda Knox was set to fly back to the United States on Tuesday after being acquitted of murder and released from prison 
			in Italy in a dramatic showdown in the battle to prove her innocence. The 24-year-old Seattle native sobbed and slumped as the verdict was 
			read out and her parents burst into tears in the courtroom in Perugia in central Italy, while British victim Meredith Kercher's family sat in 
			stunned silence. She was driven back to the Capanne prison near Perugia and discharged a short time later. Knox was later seen being driven 
			away in a black Mercedes to be reunited with her family after four years in Italian custody.</p> 
			
			<p>Local lawmaker Rocco Girlanda, who befriended 
			Knox and published a book of interviews with her last year, told reporters outside the prison gates that Knox would take a commercial flight 
			for the United States on Tuesday.</p>
			
			<h4>'Not committing the act'</h4>
			<p>Knox was acquitted "for not committing the act," judge Claudio Pratillo Hellmann said, reading out the ruling after 11 hours of jury 
			deliberations. Knox's former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, who was appealing the same convictions for the gruesome 2007 killing, was also 
			acquitted and drove away from Terni prison with his father, headed for his home town in southern Italy. Knox's sister, Deanna, told reporters: 
			"We are grateful Amanda's nightmare is over. She suffered for four years for a crime she did not commit. In the United States, the State 
			Department reacted to the verdict saying it appreciated the "careful consideration" of the case in the Italian courts. Knox's friends in Seattle 
			cheered and wept as they watched the verdict live on television. Pamela Van Swearingen, a Seattle attorney who became involved to explore what 
			legal options Knox might have, added: "I'm just so grateful. I'm surprised yet not surprised, just grateful." But outside the courtroom in Perugia 
			an angry crowd of hundreds of local residents gathered and there were shouts of: "Shame! Shame!" and "Murderers!" Some heckled Knox's lawyers 
			and one man shouted: "They're guilty!"</p>
			<h4>Guilty of slander</h4>
			<p>Although she was cleared of murder and sexual assault, Knox was found guilty of slander for incriminating the owner of a bar where she worked 
			as a waitress in her first interrogation just days after the November 1, 2007 murder. She was sentenced to time already served and will have to 
			pay compensation to the unjustly accused man, Patrick Lumumba, as well as his legal fees. The 21-year-old Kercher was found half-naked in a pool 
			of blood on the floor of her bedroom in the cottage she shared with Knox. Her body was covered in knife wounds and bruises and investigators found 
			traces of a sexual assault. At the original trial Knox was sentenced to 26 years in prison for the murder and Sollecito to 25 years. Knox, Sollecito 
			and a third person, Rudy Guede, have all denied any involvement in the killing, although Guede said he was in the house at the time of the murder 
			while Knox and Sollecito said they were at Sollecito's house that night. Prosecutors had asked for life sentences against Knox and Sollecito and 
			had alleged Kercher was killed in a drug-fuelled attack involving all three of the original suspects. "I did not kill, I did not rape, I did not 
			steal. I wasn't there," a tearful and ashen-faced Knox told the court earlier on Monday, before the eight-person jury retired to chambers to 
			consider its verdict.</p>
