		<h2><a name="All">All Blacks suffer injury scare</a></h2>
		<p><font size="3">2011-10-01 18:34</p>
		<p><i><b>Wellinton</b></i> - New Zealand's World Cup campaign took a hit on Saturday when key men Richie McCaw and Dan Carter were both sidelined 
		with late injuries before their final pool match against Canada. McCaw suffered a flare-up in a long-standing foot problem but the extent of 
		Carter's groin problem was less clear, as media speculated it could be serious enough to rule him out of the tournament. The world's all-time 
		leading points-scorer, 29, received the injury during kicking practice and would undergo a detailed assessment later, an All Blacks statement said.
		An update on his condition will be released on Sunday.</p>

		<p> Carter had been named as captain after McCaw withdrew with "niggly" pain in his right foot, following surgery for a stress fracture in February. 
		McCaw was also sidelined in May after recurring pain in same area. The hosts have already qualified for the quarter-finals as they chase their first 
		World Cup victory in 24 years. McCaw and Carter both missed New Zealand's game against Japan with a minor calf strain and a back problem respectively.
		Against Canada, Colin Slade will now start in the number 10 jersey, with hooker Andrew Hore to captain the All Blacks for the first time. Andy Ellis 
		comes onto the replacements bench. McCaw's place at openside will be taken by Victor Vito, who will pack down alongside No 8 Kieran Read, returning 
		from an ankle sprain.</p>
		
		<p> Centre Sonny Bill Williams starts in place of Ma'a Nonu, Israel Dagg moves from fullback to right wing and Zac Guildford slots in at left wing 
		instead of the injured Richard Kahui. Jimmy Cowan comes in at scrum-half, with Piri Weepu moving to the bench as Henry continued to test his half-back
		pairings. And Mils Muliaina will win his 99th cap at fullback, continuing his bid to become only the second All Black after McCaw to play 100 Tests.
		The All Blacks opened their campaign here with a 41-10 win over Tonga before thrashing Japan 83-7 and most recently beating France 37-17, and will 
		enter the knock-out phase of competition as pool winners. The neutral might argue that Canada, who pulled off a surprise 25-20 win over Tonga before 
		losing 46-19 to the French and drawing 23-23 with Japan, are on a hiding to nothing. They have been hit by the absence through injury of goal-kicking 
		fullback James Pritchard, but coach Kieran Crowley has otherwise named a full-strength Canadian team.</p>

		<h2><a name="Dan">Dan Carter out of World Cup</a></h2>

		<p><i><b>Auckland</b></i> - The All Blacks were dealt a massive blow in their quest for a World Cup crown on home soil on Sunday when star playmaker Dan 
		Carter was ruled out of the rest of the tournament with a serious groin injury. The 29-year-old fly-half sustained a "torn adductor longus tendon" 
		during kicking practice on Saturday and was immediately withdrawn from the All Blacks team to play Canada later on Sunday. "The scan confirmed our 
		worst fears, that the tendon has torn, which means he is out of the tournament," said All Blacks doctor Deb Robinson.</p>

		<p>"He has worked so hard to be at a peak for the Rugby World Cup. We will rally around him and pull together as a team," said Carter. Carter, who 
		had been due to captain the All Blacks against Canada in the absence of Richie McCaw, was replaced by Colin Slade, with Manawatu's Aaron Cruden called 
		up to the squad as cover. "He's not going to burst onto the finals and that's very sad. "He's a key All Black, not only as the person who navigates 
		the side on the field but also off the field."</p>

		<p>But Henry added: "We need to move on and play the cards we've got. "The group is shattered with this news, but they are also a resilient group.
		"You have to make the best of the situation." Usual captain McCaw also missed Sunday's final Pool A game with nagging pain from a surgically repaired 
		stress fracture in his right foot.</font></p>

		<h2><a name="Wales">Wales demolish Fiji</a></h2>
		<p><font size="3">2011-10-02 09:14</p>
		<p><i><b>Hamilton</b></i> - Dark horses Wales charged into the World Cup quarter-finals on Sunday with a classy 66-0 win over Fiji which suggested they 
		may be hitting form at the perfect time. In wet and blustery conditions at Waikato Stadium, Wales buried 2007's shock loss to the Pacific 
		islanders with a nine-try romp to set up a last-eight clash against Ireland, Italy or Australia. Warren Gatland's men finish second in Pool D with 
		15 points from three wins and a narrow, one-point loss to defending champions South Africa, with confidence high and comparatively few injuries 
		heading into next week's quarter-finals. And Rhys Priestland and veteran Stephen Jones delivered a perfect kicking performance of all nine conversions 
		and a penalty as Wales made a mockery of the woes which have affected other teams.</p>

		<p>Fiji made wholesale changes after their defeat to Samoa and it showed as slick Wales totted up four five-pointers before the break for the lone 
		bonus point they needed to progress, while amassing a 31-0 half-time lead. In afternoon drizzle at Waikato Stadium, Wales went ahead after six minutes 
		when 22-year-old captain Sam Warburton gobbled up an overthrown Fiji line-out and Jamie Roberts jinked through Fiji's midfield to score under the posts.
		Apart from occasional forays down the left, Fiji were unthreatening and Wales opened them up with a swift interchange between Roberts and George North 
		on their left to release Scott Williams, who swerved past the last defender to score. Wales were rampant and another swift move down the right involving 
		Roberts, prop Huw Bennett and Tongan-born number eight Toby Faletau -- and a strong hint of forward pass -- put 19-year-old North through for their third.
		And they sealed the bonus point just before half-time when the impressive North received quick line-out ball and dummied his way through to set up 
		Warburton for a diagonal run to the line.</p>

		<p>More pinball passing put Roberts in for his second when North did a swift one-two with Priestland to set up the centre for an easy score. Replacement 
		hooker Lloyd Burns bagged his first international try and right wing Leigh Halfpenny was the grateful recipient when Fiji's Albert Vulivuli made a hash 
		of gathering a kick behind the defence and gave him a free run to the line. Substitute scrumhalf Lloyd Williams caught Fiji's defensive napping when he 
		darted over for a poacher's try and centre Jonathan Davies grabbed the ninth and final score in the dying seconds. The result comes four years after 
		Fiji's 38-34 upset win in Nantes denied a quarter-final place to Wales, who now go into the knock-outs against the top team in Pool C, which will be 
		decided later on Sunday.</font></p>

		<h2><a name="Kirchner">Kirchner replaces Steyn</a></h2>

		Blue Bulls fullback Zane Kirchner has been called into the Springbok Rugby World Cup squad as a replacement for the injured Frans Steyn. Kirchner, 27, 
		will join the squad in Wellington on Tuesday morning in preparation for Sunday’s quarter-final. “The call was unexpected, I was cleaning the patio so 
		I was quite surprised when the phone rang. I don’t think it will sink in until I am over there in New Zealand but I am looking forward to it," said 
		Kirchner. Steyn injured his left shoulder in the final few minutes of the Springboks’ 13-5 victory over Samoa in Auckland on Friday and will return to 
		South Africa for surgery. “I am bitterly disappointed,” said Steyn. “I don’t know how the injury happened – it was at a ruck when I was cleaning someone 
		out late in the game. I was enjoying our campaign and the tournament, and to have it ended like this is very disappointing. </p>

		<p>“I’d just like to wish the squad all the best for the rest of the tournament.” Steyn scored tries in each of the Springboks’ first three matches in 
		the tournament as well as adding two long-range penalties for a haul of 21 points in his second Rugby World Cup. Four years ago he became the youngest 
		player to win a Rugby World Cup winners’ medal as a 20-year-old in South Africa’s victory in France. Kirchner has won 14 Springboks caps – the last of 
		them coming against England in November. He was a member of the Springboks’ Rugby World Cup preliminary squad but missed out on initial selection for 
		the Tri-Nations tournament because of injury. He has since returned to fitness and to Currie Cup action with the Blue Bulls.</font></p>
