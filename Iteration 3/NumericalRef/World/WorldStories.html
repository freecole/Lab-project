		<h2><a name="Britain">Britain abolishes compulsory retirement at 65</a></h2>
		<p><font size="3">2011-10-01 22:47</p>
		<p><i><b>London</b></i> - Britain's retirement age was abolished on Saturday, with new laws stopping employers from compulsorily retiring workers 
		once they reach 65. Following a consultation last year, the government decided in January to scrap the rule, and it has been gradually 
		phased out since April. The Employment Equality (Repeal of Retirement Age Provisions) Regulations 2011 came into full force on Saturday, a 
		department for work and pensions spokesperson confirmed.</p>

		<p>Despite the former right to force an employee to retire, some 850 000 people over the age of 65 are still in work in Britain. Replacing 
		the rule was part of the reforms to pensions and retirement being pursued by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat governing coalition.</p>

		<h2><a name="Talks">Talks with Taliban useless: Afghan president</a></h2>
		<p><font size="3">2011-10-01 20:30</p>
		<p><i><b>Kabul</b></i> - Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who for years pushed for reconciliation with the Taliban, now says attempts to negotiate 
		with the insurgent movement are futile and efforts at dialogue should focus instead on neighbouring Pakistan. The Afghan leader explained 
		in a videotaped speech released by his office on Saturday that he changed his views after a suicide bomber, claiming to be a peace emissary 
		from the insurgents, killed former Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani at his home on September 20. Rabbani was leading Karzai's effort to 
		broker peace with the Taliban.</p>

		<p>"Their messengers are coming and killing. ... So with whom should we make peace?" Karzai said in the recorded address on Friday to a 
		gathering of the nation's top religious leaders. "I cannot find Mullah Mohammad Omar," Karzai said, referring to the Taliban's one-eyed leader.
		"Where is he? I cannot find the Taliban council. Where is it? "I don't have any other answer except to say that the other side for this 
		negotiation is Pakistan," Karzai said. Most of the Taliban leadership is thought to be living in Pakistan, and its governing council - 
		known as the Quetta Shura - is based in the southern Pakistani city of the same name. It has long been believed that the Pakistani government 
		has sheltered and influenced the group.</p>

		<h2><a name="England">England bans cigarette vending machines</a></h2>
		<p><font size="3">2011-10-01 20:30</p>
		<p><i><b>London</b></i> - Cigarette vending machines were banned in England on Saturday, a move the government hopes will cut the number of 
		children smoking. Anyone caught selling cigarettes from the machines, usually found in pubs and clubs, could face a fine of £2 500. 
		Pubs will still be able to sell cigarettes from behind the bar. Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said: "Smoking is one of the biggest 
		and most stubborn challenges in public health. Over eight million people (about 15%) in England still smoke and it causes more than 
		80 000 deaths each year.</p>

		<p>"Cigarette vending machines are often unsupervised, making it easy for children to purchase cigarettes from them. "The ban on cigarette 
		sales from vending machines will protect children by making cigarettes less accessible to them - we want to do everything we can to 
		encourage young people not to start smoking in the first place."</p>

		<p>The British Heart Foundation charity said that about 200 000 youngsters start smoking regularly in England each year, with about 11% of 
		regular smokers aged 11 to 15 getting their cigarettes from vending machines. It is illegal to sell tobacco in Britain to anyone under the 
		age of 18. Elsewhere in the United Kingdom, cigarette vending machines are to be banned in Northern Ireland in February, while Scotland and 
		Wales are committed to introducing a ban. Meanwhile, in April 2012, all large retailers in England and Scotland will have to take all tobacco 
		off display, with small shops having until April 2015 to comply. The government is due to launch a public consultation on whether cigarettes 
		should be sold in plain packaging with no logos or branding. Smoking in enclosed public places was banned in England in July 2007.</p>

		<h2><a name="Syria">Syria dissidents meet as crackdown continues</a></h2>
		<p><font size="3">2011-10-01 18:33</p>
		<p><i><b>Damascus</b></i> -
		Representatives of Syria's six-month-old protest movement joined opposition parties in Turkey on Saturday to forge a united front against 
		Bashar Assad's regime after violence claimed at least 21 more lives. Clashes between security forces and deserters killed 11 people in a village 
		in Hama province on Friday, while another eight died during a crackdown on protests in flashpoint Homs, human rights activists said. Two men 
		died on Saturday from their wounds after being shot by security forces at Harasta and Qudsaya near Damascus, the Syrian Observatory for Human 
		Rights said. It also said the body of a third man arrested on Friday at Talbisseh in Homs province was returned to his parents. The Local 
		Co-ordination Committees group put Friday's death toll at 23.</p>

		<h4>2 700 killed</h4>
		<p>Thousands of protesters had taken to the streets on the Muslim weekly day of prayer, a lightning rod in the protests against Assad in which 
		the United Nations says 2 700 people have been killed. The protests on Friday were held under the slogan "victory for our Syria and our Yemen", 
		scene of another Arab uprising. In Istanbul, the Syrian National Council which is trying to unite opponents to Assad's regime was holding 
		negotiations behind closed doors. Several opposition movements are trying to reach an alliance, SNC member Khaled Khoja told AFP. "We have been 
		holding discussions for several days with Burhan Ghalioun, there are also Kurds and representatives of tribes," he said. Ghalioun, a France-based 
		academic, was recently designated leader of rival opposition group the National Transitional Council, which has Islamist and nationalist supporters.
		Khoja said a meeting originally scheduled for Saturday would not now take place before Sunday at the earliest because of the talks.</p>

		<h4>Read the riot act</h4>
		<p>Elsewhere on the political front, Syria's ambassador to the United States Imad Mustapha was called in to the state department and "read the 
		riot act" about an attempted attack on US ambassador Robert Ford. A mob of nearly 100 Syrians chanting hostile slogans tried to storm an office 
		in Damascus where Ford met opposition figure Hassan Abdelazim on Thursday. Mustapha "was reminded that Ambassador Ford is the personal 
		representative of the president [Barack Obama] and an attack on Ford is an attack on the United States", state department spokesperson Victoria 
		Nuland told reporters. The Assad regime had earlier accused Washington of inciting "armed groups" to commit violence against its army. The UN 
		Security Council remains divided over whether to threaten Assad's regime with sanctions over its deadly crackdown.</p>
