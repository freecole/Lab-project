		<h2><a name="Sharks">Sharks spotted: False Bay on high alert</a></h2>
		<p><font size="3">2011-10-01 18:34</p>
		<p><i><b>Johannesburg</b></i> - Shark spotters were on high alert after shark sightings were reported along the False Bay coastline on Saturday, 
		the Cape Town Disaster Risk Management Centre said. By noon three shark sightings were reported at St James and another at Muizenberg Beach, 
		said spokesperson Gregg Oelofse in a statement.</p>
		
		<p>Red flags, indicating high shark activity in the area were hoisted along shark spotting 
		beaches including Muizenberg, Kalk Bay, St James, Glencairn and Fish Hoek. The public were urged to familiarise themselves with the shark 
		warning system and to comply with it. Earlier in the week British citizen Michael Cohen was attacked by a great white shark at Fish Hoek. 
		A shark flag, indicating the presence of a great white, was flying when Cohen entered the water. Cohen, who was taken to the Constantiaberg 
		Medi-Clinic, suffered a complete amputation of his right leg above the knee, and a partial amputation of his left leg, below the knee.</p>

		<h2><a name="Contributions">Contributions from Jam taken seriously: Manuel</a></h2>
		<p><font size="3">2011-10-01 20:30</p>
		<p><i><b>Johannesburg</b></i> - All the contributions made during the National Planning Commission's (NPC) 72-hour online discussion will contribute 
		to the country's vision and planning, NPC chairperson <b>Trevor Manuel</b> said on Saturday. "Rest assured that we will take each and every contribution 
		seriously," he said in a statement. When the discussion started on Wednesday, Manuel told journalists it was being dominated by young people 
		and that employment was the main theme. By the time it ended at midday on Saturday, 10 300 people had logged in – 40% of them young people - 
		and there had been 8 700 posts, said NPC spokesperson Toivo Mohapi.</p>
		
		<p>The online dialogue focused on a vision for the country in 2030 and was guided by nine problems the NPC identified in June. These included 
		citizenry, employment, education, crime, infrastructure and health. Mohapi said information technology company IBM would put together a detailed 
		report of all the comments made during the dialogue and this would form the basis of a plan, which would be released in November.</p>

		<h2><a name="Women">Women are 'far from being liberated'</a></h2>
		<p><font size="3">2011-10-01 22:47</p>
		<p><i><b>Johannesburg</b></i> - Women in South Africa are still far from being liberated, said the Congress of SA Trade Unions deputy general secretary 
		on Saturday. "Years after the dawn of democracy, women still bear the brunt of discriminative cultural practices," Bheki Ntshalintshali said.
		He was speaking at the KwaZulu-Natal women’s' heritage dialogue on Saturday.</p>

		<p>"We need to make an assessment whether we have indeed made progress in terms of the liberation of women from the bondage of patriarchy." The 
		governments' withdrawal from the provision of basic services left women with additional burdens and responsibilities. "It is women who have suffered 
		under the wrath of privatisation of public services," Ntshalintshali said. Women, particularly in rural areas, were facing an unemployment crisis 
		and those who were employed were likely to be paid less than their male counterparts. He said it was a disgrace that there were about 600 deaths 
		per 100 000 births in a country where money was spent on elite projects like the Gautrain. "These facts should make us even more determined to see 
		the implementation of the National Health Insurance as well as the building of a preventative, as opposed to curative, healthcare system," he said. 
		He said daily patriarchal oppression, economic exploitation and racial injustice should inspire working class women to struggle for a better world.</p>

		<h2><a name="Sergeant">Sergeant arrested for corruption</a></h2>
		<p><font size="3">2011-09-30 11:31</p>
		<p><<i><b>Johanneburg</b></i> - ribe from a member of the public who was trying to report a case at the Diepsloot police station, Gauteng police said on 
		Friday. "He was asking for R100 to report a case of housebreaking and theft and would not take the complainant's statement until a payment was made 
		to him," said Warrant Officer Daniel Mavimbela.</p>

		<p>The complainant reported the matter to local community policing forum members who reported it to the police. A case of corruption was being 
		investigated and the sergeant, 42, is expected to appear in the Pretoria Magistrate's Court soon, said Mavimbela.</p>
